Final project with the result: critic score is the most effects of video games global sales

I chose the video games sales dataset because this dataset is the most relevant and familiar to me from the dataset provided by dibimbing.id

To be able to advise Metacritic as the owner of the data, I use the data science process as follows:
1. Understand business, problems, objectives
2. Data understanding, get familiar with data
3. Make data ready for modeling clean, formatting, blending, sample exploratory data analysis
4. Feature selection and model selection
5. Evaluate model quality 
6. Communicate insight, visualization, and presentation
